# Breast-cancer-prediction
A prediction model for breast cancer is a valuable tool in healthcare, utilizing various data points to assess the likelihood of an individual developing breast cancer. These models typically integrate factors such as demographics, medical history, genetic information, and lifestyle choices to generate predictions. The goal is to identify individuals at higher risk so they can undergo further screening or preventive measures.
